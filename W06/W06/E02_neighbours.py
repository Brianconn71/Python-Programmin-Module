"""Drill. Read a graph out of a dict, whatever shape the dict is.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W06/E02_neighbours.py

No output means every test passed.

`E01_river.py` has two graphs in it, and they are not stored the same way.
`RIVER_GRAPH` maps a state to a *list* of states; `ROADS` maps a town to a
*dict* of town -> minutes. All three functions here work on both, because
iterating a dict gives you its keys.
