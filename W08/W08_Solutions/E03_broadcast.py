"""Drill. Adding arrays whose shapes do not match. SOLUTION.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W08_Solutions/E03_broadcast.py

No output means every test passed.

Numpy stretches a length-1 axis to fit, so a column of 4 and a row of 4 add
up to a 4 by 4 table. Nothing is copied: the stretching is a fiction Numpy
maintains while it reads the values.

Each function below should be one line of Numpy, with no loop.

QUESTION: in combine, c can be added just as it comes, but b cannot. Why
does one of them need reshaping and the other does not?
Answer in the comment at the bottom.

# ANSWER:
# Shapes are lined up at the right-hand end. c has shape (m,), which lines up
# against the columns of A, which is what c[j] is supposed to vary along, so
# it needs nothing. b has shape (n,), and lined up at the right it would also
# fall on the columns -- the wrong axis, and an error unless n happens to
# equal m. Reshaping it to (n, 1) puts the n on the rows and leaves a 1 on the
# columns, so Numpy stretches b across each row instead.
