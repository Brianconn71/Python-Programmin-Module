"""Drill. Adding arrays whose shapes do not match.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W08/E03_broadcast.py

No output means every test passed.

Numpy stretches a length-1 axis to fit, so a column of 4 and a row of 4 add
up to a 4 by 4 table. Nothing is copied: the stretching is a fiction Numpy
maintains while it reads the values.

Each function below should be one line of Numpy, with no loop.

QUESTION: in combine, c can be added just as it comes, but b cannot. Why
does one of them need reshaping and the other does not?
Answer in the comment at the bottom.
