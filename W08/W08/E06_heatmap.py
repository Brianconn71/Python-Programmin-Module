"""Extension. Every pair of photos at once, drawn as a heatmap.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W08/E06_heatmap.py

No output means every test passed. Then run the file itself to write
distances.png, which needs the photos:

    python prep_data.py
    python E06_heatmap.py

The lecture compared one photo against all the others. Here we want all
against all: an n by n table whose entry (i, j) is the distance from photo i
to photo j. Writing that yourself would mean a loop inside a loop, so we
meet the built-in instead. scipy.spatial.distance.cdist takes two matrices
of rows and returns the distance from every row of the first to every row of
the second, and cdist(X, X) is the table we want.

QUESTION: in the picture, the diagonal running from the top left to the
bottom right is a different colour from everything around it. Why?
Answer in the comment at the bottom.
