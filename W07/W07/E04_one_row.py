"""Composition. Edit distance in one row.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W07/E04_one_row.py

No output means every test passed.

The lecture showed that `D[i][j]` needs only two cells from the row above and
the one immediately to its left. So the whole table is never needed: two lists
are enough, the row we finished and the row we are building.

Your `levenshtein_row` must return exactly what `E01`'s `levenshtein` returns.

**Do not build a table.** The point of the exercise is the space, and a grid of
`(len(a)+1) x (len(b)+1)` cells gives the right answers while missing that
entirely. Nothing here checks. You are on your honour, and the interview is
where it gets asked about.
