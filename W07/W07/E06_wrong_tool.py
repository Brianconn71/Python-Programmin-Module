"""Extension. Each algorithm on the other one's data.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W07/E06_wrong_tool.py

No output means every test passed.

Levenshtein is for symbols and DTW is for numbers. Nothing stops you running
either on the other kind of data, and what goes wrong is worth understanding:
each algorithm has an assumption built into it, and the assumption only shows
itself when it is false.

Write both functions, then answer the questions from what the doctests show.

QUESTION 1: `levenshtein` compares items with `==`, and two measured floats are
almost never exactly equal. What does the distance degenerate to? Does `tol`
really fix it?

QUESTION 2: `dtw_symbols("bookkeeper", "bokeper")` is 0.0, meaning DTW calls
the misspelling a perfect match. Explain why, and say whether DTW could ever be
used for spellchecking. Write your answers in the comments at the bottom.

# ANSWER 1: with tol = 0 every comparison of measured floats fails, so every
# cost is 1 and the distance stops depending on the values at all --- 1.0
# against 1.05 scores the same as 1.0 against 999.0. `tol` restores a little of
# the meaning, but only a little: it turns a distance into a yes-or-no at one
# arbitrary threshold, and 1.0 against 1.05 still scores the same as 1.0
# against 999.0 once both are outside it. DTW's `abs(x - y)` keeps the
# magnitude, which is the whole reason it exists.

# ANSWER 2: DTW has no deletion. Going down or right reuses a value rather than
# dropping it, so a repeated letter is free: the second "o" of "bookkeeper"
# matches the single "o" of "bokeper" at no cost, and likewise for "kk" and
# "ee". DTW therefore cannot see doubled letters at all, which is exactly the
# mistake spellcheckers most need to catch. It is the wrong tool here, and not
# because it is worse --- being blind to a held note is what makes it right for
# a time series.
