"""Can you sex a penguin from four measurements? The lecture program, complete.

Run it, run its doctests, read it. Nothing here is left for you to write.

    python E01_penguins.py              # the whole experiment
    python E01_penguins.py --fresh      # ignore the checkpoint and redo it
    python -m doctest E01_penguins.py

It writes five files next to this one:

    results.csv      one row per run: the raw data, and the settings it
                     came from. Written as the experiment goes, so a run
                     that is interrupted picks up where it left off
    table1.tex       the reference rows: what we have to beat
    table2.tex       the factorial: every setting of our own classifier
    accuracy.png     the figure in png format for slides/web
    accuracy.pdf     the figure in pdf format for publication

The question is a real one. Gorman and colleagues measured 344 penguins of
three species at Palmer Station, Antarctica, to study sexual dimorphism --
whether males and females differ in body shape. See:
https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2022-020/
Their data is in data/, and we are asking their question: given a bill, a 
flipper and a body mass, can you tell a male penguin from a female one?

Nothing here is about penguins, though. It is about how you answer a question
like that without fooling yourself: hold data back, vary one thing at a time
and everything at once, repeat it enough to get an error bar, and compare
against something stupid so you know whether the answer means anything.

Four factors, crossed:

    features        two          the four measurements, or those plus the
                                 species and island columns?
    normalisation   off / on     do we put the measurements on a common scale?
    metric          three        what does "nearest" mean?
    k               seven        how many neighbours vote?

The response is accuracy. The doctests below use small hand-made arrays,
except where they are explicitly about the data file.

After running this code, we can go to Overleaf to create a pdf document.
Here is my document, which you can view.
If you generate new figures or tables, or you want to change the text,
you can fork to your own Overleaf account. This is then a complete 
practice / demo for your research project later in the programme (ie,
not part of Programming and Tools for AI).

Go there, fork it to your own account, put your own name on it in place of
mine, and export the pdf. If you change the experiment, run this program
again and upload the three files it writes that the paper uses --- table1.tex,
table2.tex and accuracy.pdf --- over the ones already there.

#      reading the __init__ signature and expecting to find self.k and
#      self.metric, so a rename or a tidy-up here breaks them.

#      is how you tell at a glance what fit() created.
#   3. fit() returns self, so est.fit(X, y).predict(X) reads as one thought.
