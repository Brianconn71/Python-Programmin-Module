"""Drill. Missing values, and the two different things to do about them.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W09/E05_missing.py

No output means every test passed.

Real tables have holes in them. Pandas writes a hole as NaN, which is a
float meaning "not a number", and it is not equal to anything -- including
itself -- so you cannot test for it with ==. Use .isna() instead.

QUESTION: the lecture dropped the penguins whose sex was not recorded, but
filled in nothing. Why is filling in a missing *measurement* reasonable,
while filling in a missing *label* is not? Answer in the comment at the
bottom of this file.
