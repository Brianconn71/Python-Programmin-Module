"""Composition. Turning a long list of results into a table.

Run the tests:

    python -m doctest W09/E06_pivot.py

No output means every test passed.

This is the step the lecture program takes at the end. Results come out of
an experiment *long* -- one row per run, one column per thing you varied --
because that shape is easy to write and easy to add to. Tables in papers are
*wide*. pivot_table is how you get from one to the other.
